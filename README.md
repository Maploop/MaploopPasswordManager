### How to install
1. Simply download the `maplooppasswordmanager-win32-x64.zip` file from the latest release [here](https://github.com/Maploop/MaploopPasswordManager/releases/latest).
2. Extract the ZIP file into a folder in your AppData or anywhere you want the password data to be stored.
3. Run the .exe file inside of the folder you just extracted.
4. **OPTIONAL STEP** Create a desktop shortcut of the .exe file to make it easier to use for yourself! :)

### Features
By clicking the settings icon in the top right corner, you can fiddle with all of the features in the app. The current features are:
* Customizable Accet Color
* Customizable Background Color
* Customizable Background Image

And here are a couple of screenshots of how it looks with a background and without a background!

### Security
This application is open-source, as the .zip file does not have any obfuscated files. It is coded in [Electron JS](https://www.electronjs.org/) and none of the files within the ZIP file are encrypted.

**Notice:** Passwords are not saved in an online database of any sorts, they are saved in a local file in the application's data folder, this application is not supposed to be a high-level security app, but just a customizable and good looking password manager you can easily use!
